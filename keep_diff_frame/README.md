# Keeping only the different frame
... with a threshold. 

I have a wonderful dream of using this script to auto collect data with multiple combinations, that requires the only tasks is show us, at which point of the recorded video, the frame is changed. For example auto collect speech to text data, yeah, i'm sure you can imagine how i'm gonna do that. But it turns out, ...

This script not really working, even after set threshold by hand. The idea of removing previous and current frame is very useful. But sometimes the recorded videos just don't do us justice. 
I mean, they are definitely the same, in our eyes at least, but to the computer, they are different. How am I suppose to know how much the different to each other to consider the same. 

Now imagine the camera is rigged, blurry, low quality. This is a freaking nightmare.
